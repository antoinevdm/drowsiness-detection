# Drowsiness detection
AI project using openCV to prevent drowsiness and cellphone usage while driving.

OpenCV is used for eyes and blink detection in order to prevent drowsiness.
Caffe pre-trained model is used to detect cellphone on the frame.

Real world problem: Driver alertness, AI can solve it!
Perception, computer vision (OpenCV)

## Content
