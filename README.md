# Project

## Introduction
Discovering IA domain
- choose a domain, a precise subject and tool
- making a presentation and demonstration

## Subject
- Natural Language Processing
- Knowledge representation
- automated reasoning
- machine learning
And find a tool

## Schedule
Presentation at the end of the semester 20 min + 10 min Q/A

## Evaluation
Granted presentation and QA + produced code/data set/files  + one question about our work

## Content
Find a real-world problem and explain why AI can solve it
Demo of the tool + short explanation of its working

## Chosen subject
Perception, computer vision (OpenCV, OpenBR, ...)
Affective computing (Synesketch, ...)
